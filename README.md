# RandomImageBot
A Discord bot that uses the Discord4J unofficial API to listen for commands (in the form of messages /test, /image, etc.) and sends feedback. This can be in the form of sending a message back, uploading images, or uploading files. This bot will mainly focus on uploading one random image from an earlier specified directory when given the /random command in the channel.
